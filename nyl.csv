But now, acclaimed linguist Guy Deutscher has dared to reopen the issue. Can culture influence language—and vice versa? Can different languages lead their speakers to different thoughts? Could our experience of the world depend on whether our language has a word for ""blue""? Challenging the consensus that the fundaments of language are hard-wired in our genes and thus universal, Deutscher argues that the answer to all these questions is—yes. In thrilling fashion, he takes us from Homer to Darwin, from Yale to the Amazon, from how to name the rainbow to why Russian water—a ""she""—becomes a ""he"" once you dip a tea bag into her, demonstrating that language does in fact reflect culture in ways that are anything but trivial. Audacious, delightful, and field-changing, Through the Language Glass is a classic of intellectual discovery.","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oore9h_L48EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oore9h_L48EC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","1429970111","ISBN_10","9781429970112","ISBN_13","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oore9h_L48EC&source=gbs_api","en","NOT_MATURE","320","False","False","http://books.google.com/books?id=oore9h_L48EC&printsec=frontcover&dq=new+york+languages&hl=&cd=6&source=gbs_api","BOOK","2010-08-31","Metropolitan Books","17","False","True","Why the World Looks Different in Other Languages","Through the Language Glass"

At the same time this volume makes an important contribution to the scholarly literature on urban multilingualism and the sociology of language. The book contains chapters on languages of ethnolinguistic groups who arrived early in New York and which have been somewhat silenced (Irish, German, Yiddish), the languages of groups who made early contributions and continue to be heard in the city (Italian, Greek, Spanish, Hebrew), and languages which are acquiring an important voice in the city today (Chinese, Indian languages, English creoles, Haitian Creole).","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9doYiljZq3UC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9doYiljZq3UC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","311017281X","ISBN_10","9783110172812","ISBN_13","http://books.google.com/books?id=9doYiljZq3UC&dq=new+york+languages&hl=&source=gbs_api","en","NOT_MATURE","373","","","http://books.google.com/books?id=9doYiljZq3UC&printsec=frontcover&dq=new+york+languages&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api","BOOK","2002","Walter de Gruyter","1","True","False","Languages in New York City","The Multilingual Apple"

Drawing on one of the largest corpora of spoken Spanish ever assembled for a single city, Otheguy and Zentella demonstrate the extent to which the language of Latinos in New York City represents a continuation of structural variation as it is found in Latin America, as well as the extent to which Spanish has evolved in New York City. Their study, which focuses on language contact, dialectal leveling, and structural continuity, carefully distinguishes between the influence of English and the mutual influences of forms of Spanish with roots in different parts of Latin America. Taking variationist sociolinguistics as its guiding paradigm, the book compares the Spanish of New Yorkers born in Latin America with that of those born in New York City. Findings are grounded in a comparative analysis of 140 sociolinguistic interviews of speakers with origins in Colombia, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Mexico and Puerto Rico. Quantitative analysis (correlations, anovas, variable hierarchies, constraint hierarchies) reveals the effect on the use of subject personal pronouns of the speaker's gender, immigrant generation, years spent in New York, and amount of exposure to English and to varieties of Spanish. In addition to these speaker factors, structural and communicative variables, including the person and tense of the verb and its referential status, have a significant impact on pronominal usage in New York City.","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jaZlgzFrNy8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jaZlgzFrNy8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","9780199737406","ISBN_13","0199737401","ISBN_10","http://books.google.com/books?id=jaZlgzFrNy8C&dq=new+york+languages&hl=&source=gbs_api","en","NOT_MATURE","299","","","http://books.google.com/books?id=jaZlgzFrNy8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=new+york+languages&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","BOOK","2012-01-06","OUP USA","","True","False","Language Contact, Dialectal Leveling, and Structural Continuity","Spanish in New York"

Bringing together the insights of dozens of experts—from linguists to music historians, ethnographers, urbanists, and environmental journalists—amplified by cartographers, artists, and photographers, it explores all five boroughs of New York City and parts of nearby New Jersey. We are invited to travel through Manhattan’s playgrounds, from polyglot Queens to many-faceted Brooklyn, and from the resilient Bronx to the mystical kung fu hip-hop mecca of Staten Island. The contributors to this exquisitely designed and gorgeously illustrated volume celebrate New York City’s unique vitality, its incubation of the avant-garde, and its literary history, but they also critique its racial and economic inequality, environmental impact, and erasure of its past. Nonstop Metropolis allows us to excavate New York’s buried layers, to scrutinize its political heft, and to discover the unexpected in one of the most iconic cities in the world. It is both a challenge and homage to how New Yorkers think of their city, and how the world sees this capital of capitalism, culture, immigration, and more.
