Physics, chemistry, biology, geology, and astronomy made the natural world explicable through experiment, observation, and categorization. And yet one scientific field remained in its infancy. Despite millennia of observation, mankind still had no understanding of the forces behind the weather. A century after the death of Newton, the laws that governed the heavens were entirely unknown, and weather forecasting was the stuff of folklore and superstition. Peter Moore's The Weather Experiment is the account of a group of naturalists, engineers, and artists who conquered the elements. It describes their travels and experiments, their breakthroughs and bankruptcies, with picaresque vigor. It takes readers from Irish bogs to a thunderstorm in Guanabara Bay to the basket of a hydrogen balloon 8,500 feet over Paris. And it captures the particular bent of mind—combining the Romantic love of Nature and the Enlightenment love of Reason—that allowed humanity to finally decipher the skies.","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GHdhCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GHdhCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","9780865478091","ISBN_13","0865478090","ISBN_10","http://books.google.com/books?id=GHdhCQAAQBAJ&dq=new+york+weather&hl=&source=gbs_api","en","NOT_MATURE","416","","","http://books.google.com/books?id=GHdhCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=new+york+weather&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api","BOOK","2015-06-02","Macmillan","2","False","False","The Pioneers Who Sought to See the Future","The Weather Experiment"

In each case the personal is the political as these characters face everything from the emotional pitfalls of everyday life to historic catastrophes on a global scale.
