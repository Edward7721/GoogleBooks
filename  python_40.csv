The Spirit of Python helps you understand the strategies of this subtle destroyer, how he works, how to detect him, and how to break his hold from your life. You can learn to: · Recognize the early warning signs that you are under attack · Find the ways you may have unknowingly given him access into your home · Bring God’s deliverance and restoration into every area of your life We are in the middle of an unseen spiritual war. God wants to break the coils of the serpent off of your life. He wants to help you breathe again.","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Eoj_TcZ-VYcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Eoj_TcZ-VYcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","9781621362203","ISBN_13","1621362205","ISBN_10","http://books.google.com/books?id=Eoj_TcZ-VYcC&dq=python&hl=&source=gbs_api","en","NOT_MATURE","232","","","http://books.google.com/books?id=Eoj_TcZ-VYcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=python&hl=&cd=38&source=gbs_api","BOOK","2013","Charisma Media","14","True","False","","The Spirit of Python"

Thiscomprehensive reference guide makes it easy to look up the mostfrequently needed information--not just about the Python languageitself, but also the most frequently used parts of the standard libraryand the most important third-party extensions. Ask any Python aficionado and you'll hear that Python programmers haveit all: an elegant object-oriented language with readable andmaintainable syntax, that allows for easy integration with componentsin C, C++, Java, or C#, and an enormous collection of precoded standardlibrary and third-party extension modules. Moreover, Python is easy tolearn, yet powerful enough to take on the most ambitious programmingchallenges. But what Python programmers used to lack is a concise andclear reference resource, with the appropriate measure of guidance inhow best to use Python's great power. Python in aNutshell fills this need. Python in a Nutshell, Second Edition covers morethan the language itself; it also deals with the mostfrequently used parts of the standard library, and the most popular andimportant third party extensions. Revised and expanded forPython 2.5, this book now contains the gory details of Python's newsubprocess module and breaking news about Microsoft's newIronPython project. Our ""Nutshell"" format fits Python perfectly bypresenting the highlights of the most important modules and functionsin its standard library, which cover over 90% of your practicalprogramming needs. This book includes: A fast-paced tutorial on the syntax of the Python language An explanation of object-oriented programming in Python Coverage of iterators, generators, exceptions, modules,packages, strings, and regular expressions A quick reference for Python's built-in types and functionsand key modules Reference material on important third-party extensions,such as Numeric and Tkinter Information about extending and embedding Python Python in a Nutshell provides a solid,no-nonsense quick reference to information that programmers rely on themost.

It's also free and runs portably on Windows, Mac OS, Unix, and other operating systems. Python can be used for all manner of programming tasks, from CGI scripts to full-fledged applications. It is gaining popularity among programmers in part because it is easier to read (and hence, debug) than most other programming languages, and it's generally simpler to install, learn, and use. Its line structure forces consistent indentation. Its syntax and semantics make it suitable for simple scripts and large programs. Its flexible data structures and dynamic typing allow you to get a lot done in a few lines. To learn it, you'll need is some basic programming experience and a copy of Python: Visual QuickStart Guide. In patented Visual QuickStart Guide fashion, the book doesn't just tell you how to use Python to develop applications, it shows you, breaking Python into easy-to-digest, step-by-step tasks and providing example code. Python: Visual QuickStart Guide emphasizes the core language and libraries, which are the building blocks for programs. Author Chris Fehily starts with the basics - expressions, statements, numbers, strings - then moves on to lists, dictionaries, functions, and modules before wrapping things up with straightforward discussions of exceptions and classes.

However, Python has unique strengths, charms, and expressivity that can be hard to grasp at first -- as well as hidden pitfalls that can easily trip you up if you aren't aware of them. Effective Python will help you harness the full power of Python to write exceptionally robust, efficient, maintainable, and well-performing code. Utilizing the concise, scenario-driven style pioneered in Scott Meyers's best-selling Effective C++, Brett Slatkin brings together 53 Python best practices, tips, shortcuts, and realistic code examples from expert programmers. Through realistic examples, Slatkin uncovers little-known Python quirks, intricacies, and idioms that powerfully impact code behavior and performance. You'll learn how to choose the most efficient and effective way to accomplish key tasks when multiple options exist, and how to write code that's easier to understand, maintain, and improve. Drawing on his deep understanding of Python's capabilities, Slatkin offers practical advice for each major area of development with both Python 3.x and Python 2.x. Coverage includes: * Algorithms * Objects * Concurrency * Collaboration * Built-in modules * Production techniques * And more Each section contains specific, actionable guidelines organized into items, each with carefully worded advice supported by detailed technical arguments and illuminating examples. Using Effective Python, you can systematically improve all the Python code you write: not by blindly following rules or mimicking incomprehensible idioms, but by gaining a deep understanding of the technical reasons why they make sense.","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bTUFCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bTUFCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","9780134034287","ISBN_13","0134034287","ISBN_10","http://books.google.com/books?id=bTUFCAAAQBAJ&dq=python&hl=&source=gbs_api","en","NOT_MATURE","256","","","http://books.google.com/books?id=bTUFCAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=python&hl=&cd=17&source=gbs_api","BOOK","2015-02-01","Pearson Education","","True","False","59 Specific Ways to Write Better Python","Effective Python"

With this book, you'll learn how to solve statistical problems with Python code instead of mathematical notation, and use discrete probability distributions instead of continuous mathematics. Once you get the math out of the way, the Bayesian fundamentals will become clearer, and you’ll begin to apply these techniques to real-world problems. Bayesian statistical methods are becoming more common and more important, but not many resources are available to help beginners. Based on undergraduate classes taught by author Allen Downey, this book’s computational approach helps you get a solid start. Use your existing programming skills to learn and understand Bayesian statistics Work with problems involving estimation, prediction, decision analysis, evidence, and hypothesis testing Get started with simple examples, using coins, M&Ms, Dungeons & Dragons dice, paintball, and hockey Learn computational methods for solving real-world problems, such as interpreting SAT scores, simulating kidney tumors, and modeling the human microbiome.","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UbDHAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UbDHAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","9781491945438","ISBN_13","1491945435","ISBN_10","https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UbDHAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","en","NOT_MATURE","214","False","False","http://books.google.com/books?id=UbDHAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=python&hl=&cd=39&source=gbs_api","BOOK","2013-09-12","""O'Reilly Media, Inc.""","","True","True","Bayesian Statistics in Python","Think Bayes"
